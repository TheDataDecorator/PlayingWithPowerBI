# Welcome to My Power BI Playground

Here I will place any sample files or experiments I create that deal with Power BI

## Datasets
Here-in lays any datasets used in the power BI work below.

## Playing with Deneb
Here are my first learning experiences with the Deneb visual, I'll be playing around to see what is possible.

- Mundigl Bullets: using the Sales & targets dataset, it was created in Excel, randomised and then modelled within Power BI. Code from https://coacervo.co/deneb_mundigl was then used to create the chart. I learned a lot from parsing the code and will revisit it to add some finishing touches.
